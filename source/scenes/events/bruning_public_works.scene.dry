[? if not reparations_resolved: With relations between Brüning and Hindenburg increasingly strained, it would take nothing short of a miracle for this to be implemented in time. Nonetheless, it marks a turning point—and aligns with Stegerwald’s promise to the unions for job creation made just a month ago. ?][? if reparations_resolved: This marks a turning point—and aligns with Stegerwald’s promise to the unions for job creation made just a month ago. ?]
