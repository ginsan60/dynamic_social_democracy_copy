= Second Emergency Decree for Economy and Finance

To fully eliminate the national budget deficit, the emergency decree introduces spending cuts alongside a special “crisis tax.” However, with reparation payments paused, Brüning has been able to implement these austerity measures more leniently than anticipated.

Despite being less severe than expected, the decree has sparked widespread outrage, further fueling attacks from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> against the bourgeois parties that remain aligned with Brüning—particularly the [? if not lvp_formed: [? if dvp_exist: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and ?]<span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], as they're the [? if not lvp_formed and dvp_exist:parties?][? if lvp_formed or not dvp_exist:party?] representing the social groups most impacted by these changes. [? if not lvp_formed and not bourgeois_parliament and not liberal_parliament: The liberal parties' failure to persuade Brüning to remove cuts to civil servants’ salaries and the increase in the national sales tax has strained their relationship with his government.?]

We can either continue tolerating Brüning’s government or use this decree as a pretext to break with it.
