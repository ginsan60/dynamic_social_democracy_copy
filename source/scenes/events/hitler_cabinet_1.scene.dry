= The Enabling Act

As the Reichstag gets back to business once again, the bill on debate is not one of no-confidence, but rather an "Enabling Act" proposed by [+ nsdap_chancellor +] and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>. With Schleicher's blessing, the cabinet believes that certain elements of the constitution will have to suspended in order to crush the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> and Reichsbanner. 

However, this is not something the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] can easily swallow...

[? if not cvp_formed: [+ z_leader +]?][? if cvp_formed: [+ cvp_formed +]?] is personally assured significant constitutional safeguards by Schleicher, though he fails to extract a written commitment from [+ chancellor +]. It proves meaningless—[+ chancellor +] never intended to honor them.

Hitler has promised a campaign of revenge against the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have already spilled much blood on the streets. In his published manifesto, he promises a campaign of <span style="color: #7e0000;">**unspeakable**</span> <span style="color: #3f0000;">**horror**</span> against our <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span>, and endless wars of violent expansion that will ruin all of Europe.

What are we to do now?

- @fight: We will fight on the streets to prevent Hitler from taking power.
- @give_up: We will vote against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in the Reichstag.

@fight

Do we realize that this means civil war, against the full force of the state?

- @civil_war: Yes.
- @give_up: We are not ready for war. Instead, we will vote against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in the Reichstag.

@give_up

Speeches are made. Votes are held. Bullets fly in the streets. Some <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> are killed or jailed. Others flee the country. What can votes even do at this juncture?

The Reichstag is burned, ostensibly by a foreign <span style="color: #700000;">communist</span>. In the wake, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> pass decrees giving them unlimited power. They, combined with the [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if dnf_formed: <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>?], will win a majority at the next elections.

Germany is lost.

[? if not cvp_formed: [+ z_leader +]?][? if cvp_formed: [+ cvp_formed +]?] is personally assured significant constitutional safeguards by Schleicher, though he fails to extract a written commitment from [+ chancellor +]. [? if not cvp_formed: [+ z_leader +]?][? if cvp_formed: [+ cvp_formed +]?] is able to see through these lies, and whips the party's parliamentary delegation to vote against the Enabling Act. 

Schleicher regards this development as a betrayal, yet his options are limited. President Hindenburg remains the true deciding factor. He now views the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]’s refusal to support [+ chancellor +] has only deepened his impatience. Disillusioned, Hindenburg no longer considers [+ chancellor +]’s ambition to lead as a parliamentary chancellor to be credible.

title: [+ chancellor +] refuses to resign!

In an act of defiance to President Hindenburg, Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has simply refused to acknowledge the president's power to dismiss the incumbent chancellor. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> mobilize on the streets, and things could get bloody.

What are we to do now?

The President may be on our side, but the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can simply intimidate their way around him.

The Reichswehr has placed more trust in [+ president +] than in Chancellor [+ old_chancellor +], and under this influence, [+ old_chancellor +] was forced to accept his defeat. His removal, along with the replacement of many <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> cabinet ministers, has stopped Germany's slippery slope into dictatorship.

Heinrich Brüning of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] is selected as interim chancellor. The next elections are set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

@give_up_4

Unfortunately, President Hindenburg is forced to concede defeat after a war game orchestrated by Schleicher reveals that the Reichswehr and Police cannot prevail in a civil war against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> and other paramilitary forces.

Reduced to little more than a figurehead, Hindenburg remains in office—signing off on every decree, fully aware that any resistance would plunge his beloved nation into civil war.

Germany is lost.
