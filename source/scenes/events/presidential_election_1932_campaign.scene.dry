= Presidential Election campaigning

[? if nsdap_candidate_1932: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, standing alone in the electoral fight to elect [+ nsdap_candidate_1932_disp +], has little chance of winning—at least according to our advisors. However, this does not mean the election is inconsequential. The extensive <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> propaganda campaign, orchestrated by the infamous Joseph Goebbels, combined with the upcoming local elections just a month after the first round, could significantly shift public opinion. This, in turn, may pressure President Hindenburg and his entourage to adopt a more antagonistic stance toward the current government and push for a reorganization of the national government to include the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span>. [? if nsdap_candidate_1932 == "Hitler": Furthermore, Adolf Hitler possesses a remarkable charismatic ability, and his strategy of flying across Germany to deliver speeches to hundreds of thousands of otherwise indifferent voters each day rivals even that of Hindenburg. ?][? if nsdap_candidate_1932 == "Göring": With Hitler ineligible, Hermann Göring has taken up the mantle as the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s candidate. As aw staunch figure of the party’s right wing and an opponent of Strasser’s more radical policies, Göring will find it easier to attract industrial support, securing crucial funding for their extensive propaganda network. ?] ?]

[? if spd_support_reactionary: With our support for President Hindenburg, we are excluded from the United Hindenburg Committees, the main organization promoting his candidacy. Our support is unwelcome by Hindenburg himself, while Westarp and Gereke, the key leaders of the United Hindenburg Committees, will attempt to distance themselves from us as much as possible to secure moderate right-wing and industrial backing. As a result, our role in the campaign will be to rally the German Left, who remain reluctant to vote for a reactionary like him. ?][? if braun_campaign: We are running Otto Braun, one of our most renowned and respected statesmen. His reformist stance has given us a chance to attract some crossover support from the bourgeois parties. However, many outside our party would sooner die than support a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span>. Our only viable path to expanding our vote share lies in winning back disaffected <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> and mobilizing worker enthusiasm. ?][? if spd_support_thalmann: Our controversial decision to support [+ communist_candidate_1932_disp +] as a leftist unity candidate has deeply polarized German politics, setting the stage for a final showdown between <span style="color: #9B0000;">Marxist</span> and Capitalism. A civil war is not even out of the question, regardless of which candidate emerges victorious. With the German Left united behind [+ communist_candidate_1932 +], our electoral base has little room to grow—we can only hope that the workers turn out in full force at the polls. ?][? if rosenfeld_campaign: We are running Kurt Rosenfeld, a lesser-known figure from our left wing. His leftist stances have given us a chance to attract the support of the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>, but have completely closed the door to support from the bourgeois parties. Our only viable path to expanding our vote share lies in winning back disaffected workers, mobilizing their enthusiasm, and persuading our more reformist middle-class and rural elements to stick with the plan. ?][? if eckener_campaign: We are running Hugo Eckener, a famed non-partisan Zeppelin captain and personally conservative figure. His rightist stances have left the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> vulnerable to defections to the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>, but have completely opened the door to unified support from the bourgeois parties. We can either shore up support for Eckener within the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> itself, or focus on maximizing crossover support and strengthening our cooperation with bourgeois allies. ?]

In a meeting with Chancellor Brüning, Defense Minister Groener, General Schleicher, Finance Minister and Vice-Chancellor Hermann Dietrich, and our own Carl Severing, discussions focused on the upcoming presidential election and the organization of an effective propaganda campaign for Hindenburg. Severing outlined the threat that <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>—particularly the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>—posed to state authority and emphasized the election's critical role in keeping the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in check.

All present agreed that a decisive victory for Hindenburg and a campaign free from violent disturbances would greatly accelerate Germany’s economic recovery and domestic political stabilization. Achieving this, however, would require the use of state funds. Dietrich himself passionately advocated for this, having secretly transferred 1.8 million marks to Severing and the Prussian government with the understanding that the funds would be distributed among various pro-Hindenburg organizations in the State of Prussia. This approach allowed Dietrich and the government to support pro-Hindenburg groups outside the right-wing United Hindenburg Committees.

Prominent leaders of the Lutheran Church have endorsed President Hindenburg, arguing that despite their historical political neutrality, his reelection is a pressing necessity. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church is even more united in support of Hindenburg than it was for Wilhelm Marx in 1925. Catholic leaders, historically skeptical of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>, have actively discouraged their members from joining <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> paramilitary organizations.

Prominent leaders of the Lutheran Church have endorsed President Hindenburg, arguing that despite their historical political neutrality, his reelection is a pressing necessity. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church is even more united in support of Hindenburg than it was for Wilhelm Marx in 1925. Catholic leaders, historically skeptical of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>, have actively discouraged their members from joining <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> paramilitary organizations.
