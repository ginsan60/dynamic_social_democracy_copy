= Presidential Election Candidates

With the 1932 German Presidential election coming up next month, we need to decide whether to run a candidate of our own or support one from another party. [? if hindenburg_run: Many are calling for us to support the incumbent Hindenburg, despite his <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> tendencies. Contrary to fears, he hasn’t used his office to destroy the republic yet, so supporting him would hopefully prevent the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, who actually support destroying the republic, from winning. ?][? if not hindenburg_run: With Hindenburg's withdrawal, the German Right is in disarray, struggling to find a candidate who can attract support from the moderate right and middle, while also embodying the unifying character of Hindenburg. It’s likely that the candidate they put forward will have a military or industrial background and will be distanced from the partisan bickering of politics. ?]

On the other hand, many in our party are calling for [+ spd_candidate_1932_disp +] to run again, but he is reluctant. [? if kpd_relation >= 50 : Another strange possibility is an united front with the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span>, either to support their candidate or our own candidate. ?][? if sapd_formed: The <span style="color: #9B0000;">**SAPD**</span>, our former leftists, are likely to share an endorsement with the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span>. ?]

Anyhow, let's see who will be the candidates on <span class="tooltip-text" title="good game">the campaign trail</span>.

Karl Jarres, having been compelled to withdraw his candidacy in 1925 in favor of Hindenburg, has once again entered the race. While not an overtly partisan figure—having remained relatively quiet in national politics in recent years—Jarres is expected to share many of the same anti-<span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> biases that Hindenburg currently harbors. Moreover, he subscribes to the "taming strategy" concerning the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. It is imperative that we field a candidate of our own to prevent such an outcome.

His candidacy is supported by the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>.

Hans Luther, former Chancellor of the first federal right-wing coalition and key figure in addressing the hyperinflationary crisis, is certainly not lacking in the experience required to assume the presidency of the Reich. Among his peers, he stands out as relatively open to constructive cooperation with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, though it is clear that he favors a presidential bourgeois government over continued <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> participation in power. Despite his party affiliation, he is widely viewed as a non-partisan candidate.

His candidacy is supported by the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?]. [? if not lvp_formed: He is also nominally supported by the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>. ?]

Konrad Adenauer, a staunch advocate of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>'s strategy to "leave the tower" and open itself to Protestant support, has decided to run for the presidency after achieving that very aim. Still relatively inexperienced in national politics, the Mayor is known for his strong anti-Prussian stance—going so far as to reject a chancellorship offer in 1926 on the grounds that Stresemann was "too Prussian." Aligned with Stegerwald and situated on the party's right wing, Adenauer has expressed interest in the so-called "taming strategy" toward the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>.

Heinrich Brüning, a politician we know all too well, is running for the most powerful position in the Reich. He has a long history, tracing back to the Christian Trade Unions and his mentorship under Stegerwald, eventually rising to become the leader of the party's parliamentary group and its candidate for Chancellor. Despite his record of favoring austerity and deflationary policies in response to the Great Depression, he is a flexible figure—intelligent enough to recognize the dangers of the "taming strategy," and not entirely opposed to governing alongside the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

Adam Stegerwald, situated on the right wing of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>, and having advocated for it to "leave the tower" and open up the party to Protestants, has made himself a controversial figure among many.

By some miracle for the German Right, they have managed to persuade Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck—renowned for his successful guerrilla campaign in German East Africa during the Great War—to run for the presidency. However, the circumstances now are far more dire than they were in 1925. The German Right is significantly less unified behind Lettow-Vorbeck than it had been for President Hindenburg.

How Lettow-Vorbeck would govern remains uncertain. It is highly likely that, much like Hindenburg, a camarilla of close advisors would shape his decisions from behind the scenes.

Kuno von Westarp, a familiar figure in German politics, has long been a stalwart of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, once serving as both party leader and head of its parliamentary group. While not entirely opposed to his party’s participation in a <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> system, he has made no secret of his monarchist aspirations.

President Hindenburg is, of course, running for re-election, and many in our party are prepared to support him as the last bastion of democracy against Hitler and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. The <span class="tooltip-text" title="Following Hindenburg's overseeing of Germany's crushing victory at Tannenberg in the Great War, Hindenburg has become the center of a massive personality cult, lauded as the living ideal of German masculinity and patriotism. He is the embodiment of the best virtues of Prussian tradition.">Hindenburg Mythos</span> serves as a powerful rallying point for all parties, as he maintains high personal popularity despite everything Germany has endured. However, the more support he receives from the German left and center, the more Hindenburg views it as a stain on his personal honor. The refusal of August von Mackensen and other high-ranking officers with whom he served during the war to embrace his candidacy proved particularly painful to the Reich president.

In response, he may shift further to the right after the election in an effort to restore his sense of honor and to appease his former comrades and friends on the German Right. This urge has only been reinforced by the Harzburg Front’s refusal to support him without concessions, as they see Hindenburg as the greatest obstacle to their rise to power.

Otto Braun has been floated around as a candidate for the presidency once more, after his failed run in 1925.

It's unlikely for bourgeois parties to outright support a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> for President, even with his reformist and right-wing leanings within our own party. Carl Severing and other Prussian officials have instead proposed running Hugo Eckener, a nationalist anti-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> Zeppelin pilot[? if hindenburg_run:, but this possibility has been extinguished with Hindenburg's decision to run again?][? if not hindenburg_run:, but he is personally reluctant?].

None of the candidates are worthy of our support, and we are either unable or unwilling to field a candidate of our own.

It takes effort to launch a somewhat unexpected campaign. First, Eckener must be convinced to run. He isn't particularly eager to be the candidate of the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>, as it would invite slander from the German Right—whom he feels a greater affinity with.

With his status as a non-<span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span>—and even conservative—unity candidate, and his non-partisanship, Eckener is positioned to attract endorsements from a wide range of parties. However, much of this depends on their relationship with us, as our backing alone is enough to disgust many otherwise eager supporters. The [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> are likely to back Eckener, although the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> requires convincing. ?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> is likely to back Eckener, although their industrial-right elements object to the arrangement. ?] The [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] is nominally supportive, although the <span style="color: #A2D8E0;">**BVP**</span> remains another problem. Finally, the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>[? if left_split:&nbsp;and <span style="color: #9B0000;">**SAPD**</span>?] are firmly opposed to supporting a bourgeois conservative—for obvious reasons.

Hopefully, their support will outweigh the loss of popularity and internal dissent caused by the resignation of our most well-known figure.
