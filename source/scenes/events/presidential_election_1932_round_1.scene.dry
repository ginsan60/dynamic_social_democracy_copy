Otto Gessler has made a comeback and won the presidency. Despite his[? if lvp_formed: &nbsp;former?] affiliation with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span>, he isn’t as friendly as his colleagues.

From former Chancellor to President, Hans Luther has secured the presidency. Known for his technocratic beliefs, he's unlikely to rock the boat in either political direction. Let’s hope he continues to keep the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> out of power.

Heinrich Brüning may be an advocate of economic austerity, but as president, he’s a clear step up from Hindenburg in both his <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> convictions and his stance toward the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

Unfortunately, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, a <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalist</span> not far different from Hindenburg, has been elected president.
